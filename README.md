# Buckysquares

## About Buckysquares
Buckysquares is a re-creation of the game *Tetris* for Buckyboards. 

## Requirements
In order to run it a Tiva Launchpad powered "Bucky Board" is required. Buckyboards, however, are only available from UW-Madison ECE. Other compatible boards could probably be used but nothing is guarenteed.

## Running It
The most straightforward way of getting Buckysquares to run is to use ARM Keil Tools and load the included project, found in the *ECE210-buckysquares* directory. Once the project is loaded, compile and Flash.

## Usage
This project has no restriction on use except for the fact it can not be used as an academic project in any class except by the authors. Please read the LICENSE for more info.
